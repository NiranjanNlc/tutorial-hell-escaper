# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Tutorial Escape Platform is designed to help developers, particularly beginners, transition from passive tutorial consumption to active project building. The platform addresses the common problem of "tutorial hell" by providing structured, bite-sized project guidance with instant feedback and accountability features. This MVP prototype focuses on core essentials: basic skill assessment, simple project generation, basic progress tracking, and minimal targeted support resources to demonstrate feasibility.

## Requirementss

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer stuck in tutorial hell, I want to take a simple skill assessment quiz, so that I can get a basic personalized project recommendation based on my current knowledge level.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user visits the platform THEN the system SHALL present a basic onboarding quiz with 3-5 questions
2. WHEN the user completes the skill assessment THEN the system SHALL capture their programming language knowledge and basic skill level
3. WHEN the assessment is submitted THEN the system SHALL generate a simple tailored starter project recommendation
4. IF the user has beginner-level skills THEN the system SHALL suggest a foundational project like a basic to-do app

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer ready to build, I want to receive a simple project idea broken into small milestones, so that I can make steady progress without feeling overwhelmed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system generates a project THEN it SHALL provide one focused project idea without stretch goals
2. WHEN a project is assigned THEN the system SHALL break it into 3-5 tiny, actionable milestones
3. WHEN displaying milestones THEN each milestone SHALL include a short guiding hint
4. WHEN a user views a milestone THEN the system SHALL show clear, specific tasks like "setup repo" or "add basic feature"

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer working on a project, I want to track my progress visually, so that I can stay motivated and accountable to completing the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts a project THEN the system SHALL display a simple visual progress tracker with all milestones
2. WHEN a user completes a milestone THEN they SHALL be able to mark it as "done"
3. WHEN milestones are marked complete THEN the system SHALL update the visual progress indicator
4. WHEN viewing progress THEN the user SHALL see a basic checklist format showing completed and remaining tasks

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer who gets stuck on a milestone, I want access to targeted help resources, so that I can get unstuck without falling back into tutorial consumption patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views any milestone THEN the system SHALL provide one relevant, concise resource link
2. WHEN help resources are provided THEN they SHALL link to specific documentation (e.g., MDN or official docs)
3. WHEN a user accesses help THEN the resource SHALL be directly related to the specific milestone task

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want a clean, distraction-free interface, so that I can focus on building rather than navigating complex features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the platform THEN the interface SHALL prioritize simplicity and clarity
2. WHEN displaying project information THEN the system SHALL show only essential details for the current milestone
3. WHEN users navigate the platform THEN they SHALL have clear paths between assessment, project view, and progress tracking
4. WHEN viewing any page THEN the system SHALL use a clean design with focused content
